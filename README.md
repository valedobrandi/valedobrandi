  Hi! I'm a Fullstack Developer with a passion for test-driven development, refactoring, and writing clean code. My main tools are React.js, Node.js, and SQL databases. Through testing libraries and a dedication to building responsive websites, I thrive on using these technologies to develop scalable projects. I love collaborating with others, leveraging my teamwork skills in fast-paced environments.

Previously, I excelled in roles focused on modernizing service delivery in national parks, ensuring exceptional visitor experiences. My dedication to quality was further demonstrated through my collaboration with teams to design and maintain a garden for a Michelin 3-star restaurant.

Having relocated from Brazil to work on the restaurant project in France several years ago, I'm eager to continue leveraging my adaptability and passion for growth in new endeavors.
