## üíª
### Hi there! üëã  

I primarily work with **TypeScript, Python, and C/C++**.  
My projects and studies focus mainly on **Full Stack Web Development**.  

I handle every stage, from deploying on servers using Docker and Nginx for flexibility and scalability to implementing security measures with Docker Secrets and HashiCorp Vault.  

On the backend, I build APIs with Node.js (Express) and Django.  
On the frontend, I strive to maximize **React‚Äôs potential, especially with Redux Toolkit (RTK), which is an incredible tool.  

Over the past year, I have been dedicating myself to **C/C++**, a highly efficient language with enormous potential for embedded systems.  

Anyone interested in these technologies and looking to exchange ideas is always welcome to reach out!


## üõ†Ô∏è **About My Work**

Most of it are full-stack webpages with backend in JavaScript (Express) and Python (Flask/Django) and React.
