Hi! I'm a Fullstack Developer with a passion for test-driven development, refactoring, and writing clean code. My main tools are React.js, Node.js, and SQL databases. Through testing libraries and a dedication to building responsive websites, I thrive on using these technologies to develop scalable projects. I love collaborating with others, leveraging my teamwork skills in fast-paced environments.
