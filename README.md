## üíª
``` I primarily work with TypeScript, Python, and C/C++.
My projects and studies focus mainly on Full Stack Web Development.
I handle every stage, from deploying on servers using Docker and Nginx for flexibility and scalability to implementing security measures with Docker Secrets and HashiCorp Vault.
On the backend, I build APIs with Node.js (Express) and Django.
On the frontend, I strive to maximize React‚Äôs potential, especially with RTK (Redux Toolkit), which is an incredible tool.

Over the past year, I have been dedicating myself to C/C++, a highly efficient language with enormous potential for embedded systems.
Anyone interested in these technologies and looking to exchange ideas is always welcome to reach out!```
